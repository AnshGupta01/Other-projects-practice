# Other-projects-practice
This Repository contains all my simple projects created with java technologies such as Spring MVC, JSP, Servlets, Hibernate and more. It contains projects as well as simple implementations which I can look back upon.

I add projects by cloning them from their private repos, hence I do loose their history.
