# Other-projects-practice
This Repository contains all my simple projects created with java technologies such as Spring MVC, JSP, Servlets, Hibernate and more. It contains projects as well as simple implementations which I can look back upon.

Also, I've added front-end projects to this repo which include HTML/CSS clones and React.js projects.

I add projects by cloning them from their private repos, hence I do loose their history.
